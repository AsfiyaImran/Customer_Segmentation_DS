# Customer_Segmentation_DS

Customer segmentation is the practice of segregating the customer base into groups of individuals based on some common characteristics such as age, gender, interests, and spending habits


Perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis. The resulting segments can be ordered from most valuable (highest recency, frequency, and value) to least valuable (lowest recency, frequency, and value).


In this project, the data is first cleaned and then transformed to perform cohort analysis.


Then data modelling is done using K-means clustering to find the optimal number of clusters.


A tableau dashboard is also created to visualize the resutls.
